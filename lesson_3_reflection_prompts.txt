When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working from multiple computers or when others collaborate to it.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because those changes may have been made by someone else and might not 
    be wanted in a specific local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches are used to have different versions of a repository, 
    clones are used to get a local copy of a repository whereas 
    forks are used to also have a remote copy on GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
