What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It puts the repository into the current directory so that version control is enabled.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains files that are going to be committed next. It gives the possibility to commit a logical unit of changes even if more changes were made in the meantime on other files that don’t belong to the same logical unit of changes and shouldn’t be included in the next commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

Using the git diff command you can see the changes that have been made.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

When there’s a need to keep different modified versions, for example a version in another language or a version with experimental features, branches help building those versions separately.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Git's automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
